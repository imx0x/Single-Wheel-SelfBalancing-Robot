# Single Wheel Self Balancing Robot

## Mini-project





### Introduction

> Technique used in making the self balancing system is same as the principle used in balancing of the Inverted Pendulum. 

> Balancing of the inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms 

> Over the years, advances in technologies have made it possible to create a compact self-balancing system that can be used for a wide range of applications, such as entertainment, research, education, and transportation.


### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
- To Design a compact, lightweight and comprehensible self balancing uni-wheel system which can maintain stability and balance even on uneven surfaces or in dynamic environment. Additionally, other aspects like mobility, durability and robustness are also to be considered


### OBJECTIVE : 

- 1. To design a stable mono-wheel self balancing system using inverted pendulum methodology.

- 2. To control the system bi-directionally at variable speeds. 

- 3. To develop a system that can traverse and maintain equilibrium without any human intervention.


# FEATURES :
- A mobility mechanism for robots that can be used in tight spaces, which requires a small footprint to move omnidirectionally, as well as to be highly maneuverable.

- A system which will be able to balance itself using pitch and speed control feedback mechanisms.

- A versatile and efficient solution for a range of applications where stability is a major concern in dynamic environments.
